## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
Conditional statements are a type of branching in ruby in which the different variable states
pass through different block variables.
examples would be if/elsif/else


1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
You would want to use an if-statement if (pun intended) you had different block variables
for different variable states.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

if var == state
  puts "Conditional"
end

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

booleans

if var == var-state || var_state_2
  puts "conditonal"
end

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?

if var == 1
  puts "Conditional"
elsif var == 2
  puts "Other_Conditional"
else var > 3
  puts "Other_Other_Conditional"
end

note : the boolean evaluation syntax can vary

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

we can use them for comparisons and combing expressions
